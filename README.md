# Roguelike Game Project

Welcome to my roguelike game project! This is a work in progress, and I'm currently learning Rust by following the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## About the Project

This project is a roguelike game, a type of game that combines elements of role-playing games with the randomness and replayability of roguelike games. The game is being developed in Rust, a systems programming language that is known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency.

## Current Status

This project is currently a work in progress. I'm learning Rust and applying what I've learned to build the game. I'm following the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to deepen my understanding of the language and its best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and start exploring the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
